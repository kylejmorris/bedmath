	<h3>What is Bedmath?</h3>
			<p>
				Bedmath is a globalized solution to a problem plaguing millions of students involved in Mathematics.
				We are grabbing hold of the traditional tutoring system, and building it up to match the modern technological
				environment we live in today. Students will now be able to receive instant tutoring <strong>whenever they want,
				wherever they want, and fit to their financial needs.</strong> </p>
			<p>
				The problem becomes most clear upon preparing for an upcoming math test, finishing a nearly due assignment, or dealing with any concept that remains ambiguous. Being a student in highschool myself,
				I have been directed to either
				<ul>
					<li>A tutoring system held in class during lunch hours</li>
					<li>An outside tutor in which either transports to my location, or requires me to leave home to meet them.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite these being two common solutions, the inefficiency is becoming more and more noticeable to students, parents, and teachers. The average 40 minutes spent travelling to and from my tutor is more
				than enough time to get my main concerns out of the way. Along with this I often don&rsquo;t need a full 1 hour drill-session that costs up to $30. Students need an easy access gateway to reputable support.
				Support that fits both their financial needs, and busy schedule.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bedmath is the solution, striving to become the leading source of mathematics tutoring for students
				attending high school or post secondary education. Bedmath provides cost-efficient tutoring via a globalized location (being the internet), and along with this we are initially crowd sourcing tutoring! Sometimes (often) a student won&#39;t fully understand a mathematical concept; but this isn&#39;t always the teachers fault. Everyone learns differently, so Bedmath puts strong focus on this. When you seek help with Bedmath you receive solutions from all kinds of angles. This lets students not only learn, or understand, but rather embrace the concept so they may truly utilize it in the future!

			<p class="next"> The user submits a request for help from one of our verified tutors, along with the exact price they are willing to pay for an answer. There request will be categorized by subject, and filtered through it&rsquo;s respective feed, so any online tutors can configure their homepage to see all questions within their field of experience. We don&rsquo;t hire our tutors, but rather adorn active members of the site with badges earned by accurately answering
				questions. You don&rsquo;t have to be a certified tutor to post answers, but all answers from unrecognized users will be explicitly labeled as such.We are carefully forming this system however, to ensure that tutors are selected in the best form possible; it is not done by an automated system. All reputable
				tutors are hand picked by staff to assure efficiency.
			</p>
			<p>
				During the upcoming months, Bedmath wishes to spread to students around the globe ! So please let us know what you&#39;d like to see on Bedmath, and we will do our very best to make it happen!

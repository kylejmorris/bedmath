This file contains information on file edits when transferring the site from local to public server. Although I'm trying to make everything dynamic, some things are just static as heck right now. Note to kyle: visit these files and update them upon transer.
- Comments are supplied in files that require editing, just a security measure.

1) /libs/path.php
2) /libs/config/database_config.php


The list content below should hopefully function upon site transfer. Not sure yet though, may have to do more edits anyway. 
3)              /views/goggallery/goggallery.php // Have to upload form direction
4)              /template/content/header.php // Change url to new css page, same thing with footer file. 
5)              /views/goggallery/viewgallery.php // Line 7, update url so images are being located from http://images.globeofgeek.com, be sure to include "http://" or else php will assume it's a relative directory... 
6)              /controllers/goggallery.php // Line 57, removing the "." from file extension. 

Note to self: Fix these things, in order to receive quicker tranfer time...

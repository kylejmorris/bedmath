Future updates:
- enable email activation features
- encrypt database passwords. Need to figure out best encryption, also make sure it works with joomla eh? 
- make it look better, site design is garbage right now. 
- Create page listing articles by category. Page will be: globeofgeek.com/category/article/(category id goes here)
- Create module displaying recent content 
- create article hit counter
- Highscore page containing different info that can be dynamically viewed by user. Example: View users by order of most points, or view users by order of content submission.
- create table containing content category information. I can then use this to make categories for articles on the site.
- create unlock table in database containing information on when articles are unlocked and at what time. 
- Enhance form object by creating security functions that validate form data. 
- Create page that lists all submitted articles as I have stored in excel document.
- Store marked article data in database where article information is. This way I won't have to ever worry about doing it manually every month. This will take some planning though.
- For later: Create front page module that allows user to register. Have it say: "Register for free access. Only takes a second, seriously"
- Create wiki-style page containing information on frameworks classes/methods. This will be so other programmers can use API or possibly help develop. 
- Create secondary nav bar for staff, only they will see it upon logging into a staff member account.
- Create module that displays points current held in users account. Have this located at the top right of header. 

Abandoned 
- Store marked article data in database where article information is. This way I won't have to ever worry about doing it manually every month. This will take some planning though.


Completed:
- Create page that confirms form was submitted.
- create functioning login system with sessions and all that jazz. I can focus on a register page afterwards considering the login is where most of my trouble will be. 
- Made new object for managing points. Nothing has been officially done to it yet, however it will come in handy one of these days. ONE OF THESE DAYS I TELL YOU!










LOGIN SYSTEM PLANNING:
- send information to database from login form
- clarify if data exists or not
- if data exists create session for user through the user object. 



ARTICLE SYSTEM PLANNING:
- create method in article object that will determine if user has the right permissions for viewing the content. Need to create a method in users class that gets the user-rank, since I shouldn't be dealing with this logic inside of the article class...
- Create another method to determine if content was unlocked. If so, the database will print out the article to the page. If not, an error notification will be displayed prompting the user to unlock content. 
Note: In order to do this, I will have to create a couple more methods inside of the user class. These may include isUnlocked(), which will take the users id and check to see if it has been matched with an article id from the database table. 
- Must create a prompt page asking the user to pay to unlock the article. They will be notified about exactly how much it will cost to unlock. Upon unlocking the article, they will be directed to that article page with a success confirmation message on the screen. The points will have been removed from their account and the database will be updated to contain information on this transaction.

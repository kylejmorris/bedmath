Some quick bug fixes:

FILE: template/content/header.php
LINE: none
Issue: Header CSS isn't working... Again, this is only an issue on localserver. The $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] command doesn't work here nicely...

FILE: views/goggallery/goggallery.php
LINE: 5
Issue: Image url is hardcoded. Can't seem to get php in the html tags to work...



FILE: views/goggallery/viewgallery.php
LINE: 7
Issue: Image url is hardcoded... again... Stupid localhost is giving me problems with relative urls and I can't seem to make anything dynamic here...



LIGHT ISSUES: Just to be aware of:

1) Timestamp seems to be differnet on local server, thus storing the images on the server under the wrong date (technically). 



FIXED BUGS:
-none yet... this sucks...-
